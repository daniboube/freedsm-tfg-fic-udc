# FreeDSM Firmware

![gpl-v3-badge]

The FreeDSM photometer is an open hardware and open software solution for citizen light pollution monitoring based on IoT technologies. It has been created under the idea of being a low-cost (around 20-30 euros), easy-to-build and easy-to-use device, so everyone with minimum knowledge about soldering or electronics can make their own. In this repository you will find the source code necessary to make the different sensors work when connected to a Raspberry Pi Zero. It should be noted that this is an early prototype, and not a finished version, since only the work presented as my Final Degree Project in Computer Engineering is included here. Below is a list of the components needed to build it.

* Raspberry Pi Zero
* TSL2591 Optical Light Sensor
* AHT10 Ambience Sensor
* 60 degrees PMMA Lens
* GY-MPU6050 Gyroscope and Acelerometer
* Neo6mv2 GPS Module

If you want to know more about the context of the project or the device (how it is built, how it is used, results obtained, etc.), you can review the complete report of the work published in the [institutional repository](https://ruc.udc.es/dspace/handle/2183/32824) of the University of A Coruña.
